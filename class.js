Let's dissect that statement and look at its parts:

var, short for variable, is the JavaScript keyword that will create a new variable for us.
myName is chosen by a developer (that's you!). Notice that the word has no spaces, and each new word is capitalized. This is a common convention in JavaScript, and is called camelCase.
= means to assign whatever's next to the variable.
'Arya' is the value that the equals = assigns into the variable myName.
After the variable is declared, we can print the variable with: console.log(myName). This will print 'Arya' to the console.
